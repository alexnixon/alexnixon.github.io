<p>I'd recommend reading these books. They've each given me that special feeling you get when reading something which is deeply true and deeply important. I think the feeling is one of connection with the author - <em>feeling</em> the writing just as strongly as the author themselves. And they have each changed my views of the world for the better.<p/>
<p>I would have hoped to include some books on soft skills in software engineering but I haven't found any which are as impactful as the general "self-help-y" books here. They're just so damned good that, if you can internalize and put into practice their messages, I think they do more for your abilility to be effective in a team and effectively manage people than any specific engineering book might.</p>
