I'm always happy when people get in touch - if you're in doubt, hit send! My address is `alex.nixon.88` at the gmail domain. Email is my preferred method of communication, but you should also be able to reach me via Twitter.

I try to reply to all emails but if I miss one then don't take it personally - I'm either busy or just failing to manage my inbox.

Things which I'd love receiving:
- Articles you've written or read and found interesting on software engineering, technology, or finance
- Feedback on anything I've written
- Invitations to chat about any aspect of software - even in person (I'm based in London)
- Anything else technology related!
