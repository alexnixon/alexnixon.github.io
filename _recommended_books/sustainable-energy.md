I found this gem on [GatesNotes](http://www.gatesnotes.com). Bill Gates calls it "one of the best books on energy that has been written. If someone is going to read just one book I would recommend this one".
 
The book explores how a country's energy equation, energy used === energy generated, might be balanced in a low-carbon world. Some combination of moving to low-carbon generation or using less energy overall is needed, and this book looks at the potential of each of these with the UK as a case study.

The book is still relevant over a decade from publication because its calculations aren't tied to the technology or economics of the day. Rather, they're based on the underlying physics which leads to some startling results: for example, if [NIMBYs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIMBY) didn't exist and we could, *somehow*, build wind turbines over the windiest 10% of the UK's entire landmass, then we would only generate enough energy to cover *half* that used by our cars. And the picture for offshore wind is just as bleak.

Best of all - the book is available for [free](https://www.withouthotair.com/).
