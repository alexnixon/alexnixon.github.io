This gives an absolutely fascinating insight into how the human mind works. Though a few years on from reading this I would struggle to remember the specifics of the experiments that demonstrate the biases, one thing has stuck with me: an appreciation for how ludicrously irrational everyone – *including myself* – is. It's a highly enjoyable read if you're interested in how people think, but the main reason it makes this list is for how incredibly humbling it is to realise that you are not the exception.
