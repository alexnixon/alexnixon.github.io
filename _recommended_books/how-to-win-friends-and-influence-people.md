To say I was sceptical before reading this would be an understatement. When I hear the words "self-help" I can't help but imagine a greasy-haired grifter on stage in a local community centre, spouting meretricious clich√©s about how to get rich but stopping just short of that one key detail which will be revealed when you pay for the next $500 seminar.

It turns out I couldn't have been more wrong about this book. If I could give it a subtitle, it would be "People don't cooperate with assholes so here's how to avoid being one".

The book comprises a list of "principles", each one being something to bear in mind when you find yourself interacting with people. They're geared towards management/leadership interactions but are still applicable to everyday life.
