This was recommended reading for a course I took in university, [Mark de Rond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_de_Rond)'s negotiation course at the [Judge Business School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Judge_Business_School).

Admirably concise – the audiobook is just over 6h – the book teaches a method for reaching agreement fairly and amicably when negotiating with others. And as the introduction points out, "everyone negotiates something every day", whether buying a house or negotiating bed time with the kids. 

It's one of the few books that I regularly re-read to keep the ideas fresh.
